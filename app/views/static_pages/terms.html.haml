      %li
        %h5 Your Account
        %p In order to make purchase on our site you will need to register by creating an account with LunchOn (either by registering directly with us or by allowing a LunchOn application to connect through your Facebook, or Twitter profile) (an “Account”). If you choose to create an Account, you agree to provide only accurate, complete registration information, and you will keep that information up-to-date if it changes. You may only create and hold one account that you are solely responsible for managing which is non-transferrable and may not be sold, combined or otherwise shared with any other person. Any violation of these limitations may result in termination of your account, and any other accounts related to you, without limitation, you may forfeit any pending, current or future promotional account credits and any unredeemed vouchers in your account. If we terminate your account, you may not re-enroll or join under a new account unless we formally invite you. If you commit fraud or falsify information in connection with your use of the Site or in connection with your LunchOn account, your account will be terminated immediately. Please notify us immediately if you become aware that your account is being used without authorization.
      %li
        %h5 Deals
        %p LunchOn is a service provider for the merchant that provides consumers with opportunities to purchase meals at a discount (referred to as “Deal,” and plurality, “Deals”) from third-party merchants (each the “Merchant”), except as otherwise expressly identified, using a time-limited promotional voucher exchangeable for Merchant goods and services (a “Voucher”). The promotion of each Deal works as a form of advertisement for the Merchant by LunchOn and its affiliates. If a Merchant or venue refuses to honor any voucher, LunchOn will refund the amount paid upon request in the original form of payment, or will credit the value to the account of the purchaser
        %p By purchasing any voucher you agree to the terms of this Agreement and these Terms of Sale. By purchasing, viewing a mobile version, printing, accepting, using or attempting to use any voucher, you agree to these Terms of Sale on the voucher itself and any additional, deal specific terms advertising the voucher at the time of purchase (collectively, the “fine print” regardless of how labeled)Your Account. These rules apply to all promotional vouchers that we make available, unless a particular voucher’s fine print states otherwise, and except as otherwise required by law. In the event of a conflict between these rules and a voucher’s fine print, the voucher’s fine print will control.
        %h6 How it Works
        %p By purchasing any voucher you are agreeing to the terms, restrictions and conditions associated with the Deal. Once you have placed your order, you will receive a confirmation of the Deal and your credit card or other payment mechanism will be charged for the amount of the Deal. We will notify you by email when the Voucher for the Deal is ready to be used. When you create an Account in order to purchase any Deal, we collect information to allow you to pay for your Deals and so we can provide you with easy access to print your Deals, view your past purchases and modify your preferences.
        %p Vouchers have two separate values: (a) the “amount paid” and (b) the promotional value. The “promotional value” is the additional value beyond the amount paid. Together, the amount paid and the promotional value equals the “full offer value” of the voucher. For example, if you pay $30 for a voucher that gets you $60 of goods from a Merchant, the full offer value is $60, the amount paid is $30 (this amount does not expire until it is used or is refunded), and the promotional value is $30 (this amount expires on the date stated on the voucher unless expiration of the promotional value is prohibited by law). The promotional value of a LunchOn voucher will EXPIRE on the date specified, or on the date calculated by the promotional period indicated on the face of the voucher, unless prohibited by law. The amount paid WILL NEVER EXPIRE. 
        %h6 Merchant is the Issuer
        %p The Merchant is the issuer of the Voucher and is solely responsible for redeeming the Voucher. The Merchant is also solely responsible for all goods and services it provides to you and for any and all injuries, illnesses, damages, claims, liabilities and costs it may cause you to suffer, directly or indirectly, in full or in part, whether related to the use or redemption of a Voucher or not, as well as for any unclaimed property liability arising from unredeemed or partially redeemed Vouchers. Unless otherwise indicated in a Deal or other offer, LunchOn is solely the marketer of the Merchant’s good, and may from time to time engage third parties or affiliates to administer Voucher management on behalf of Merchants. You hereby irrevocably waive all rights related to, and release LunchOn and its subsidiaries, affiliates, partners, officers, directors, employees and agents from, any liabilities arising from or related to any act or omission of a Merchant in connection with your use of a Voucher or the products and/or services it provides in connection with it.
        %h6 Vouchers
        %p Unless otherwise stated on the Voucher or required by law, the following additional terms apply to all Vouchers:
        %ul
          %li Vouchers must be redeemed in their entirety in one visit to a Merchant.
          %li Vouchers are not redeemable for cash.
          %li Vouchers cannot be combined with any other coupons or promotions.
          %li Vouchers cannot be used for taxes, tips, prior balances and/or shipping or handling, as applicable.
          %li Neither LunchOn nor the Merchant is responsible for lost or stolen Vouchers or Voucher reference numbers.
          %li Duplicate use, sale or trade of a Voucher is prohibited.
          %li Unless otherwise stated in the Fine Print, the Voucher price does not include sales, value-added or use taxes, which may be charged to you separately by the Merchant at the time you redeem the Voucher.

        %h6 Refunds
        %p Except as explicitly stated otherwise in the terms of a specific Deal, if You change your mind about purchasing a Deal, just write us at info@LunchOn.co within seven (7) days of your purchase and LunchOn will refund the Paid Portion of any unredeemed Voucher to Your purchasing credit/debit card or other payment mechanism. In addition, LunchOn will always honor your request for a refund of the Paid Portion of any unredeemed Voucher if the Merchant goes out of business before the promotional period expires. Please see the Additional Terms for refund rules applicable to other LunchOn products.
        %h6 Deal Availability
        %p LunchOn does not represent or warrant that any product or service promoted on the Site will be available for purchase by any particular person. Some of our Deals are limited in number. Any attempt by you to obtain more than the permitted number of Vouchers specified for a particular Deal, including, without limitation, using multiple or different identities, credit cards, forms, registrations or addresses, will void your purchase may subject you to Account termination.
        %h6 Pricing Information
        %p We calculate discounts on our Sites in association with the quantity of meals purchased in a single transaction. At our sole discretion, the amount of discount, and the calculation variables are subject to change without notice, however any changes will not be retroactive, nor are they intended to apply to transactions that have already been completed, regardless of whether the voucher(s) were redeemed or not. Since the pricing information on which we base our discounts may vary, any discount information that we display may or may not be representative of the prevailing discount in every area or on any particular day.
