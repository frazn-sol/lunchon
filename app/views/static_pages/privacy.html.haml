We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience with LunchOn. Persistent Cookies can be removed by following your Internet browser help file directions. In order to use our services offered through LunchOn, your web browser must accept Cookies.
